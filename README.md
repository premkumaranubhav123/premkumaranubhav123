- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that the first computer bug was literally a bug? In 1947, Grace Hopper and her team were working on the Harvard Mark II computer when they found that it wasn’t working properly. Upon investigating, they discovered a moth trapped in a relay, causing the malfunction. They "debugged" the system by removing the moth, and from that day forward, the term "debugging" became a part of software development vocabulary! 🦋💻
